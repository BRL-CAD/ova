Update VirtualBox Guest Additions to 4.2.6
Run `svn up` inside brlcad-svn, updating local copy to r54118
Run `sudo aptitude update` to update aptitude repositories
Run `sudo aptitude full-upgrade` to upgrade system
Update CMake to 2.8.10 from source [CMAKE.txt]
Update FOP to 1.1 from source [FOP.txt]
Build and install BRL-CAD as described in "README-brlcad-development.txt"
    [CMAKE.log MAKE.log MAKE_INSTALL.log]
Run `make clean`
Update $PATH in ~/.bash_aliases to use brlcad-7.22.1
Remove /usr/brlcad/dev-7.21.0
Clear Firefox history
Replace the contents of "RELEASE-NOTES.txt" with my file ("README.txt")

DIDN'T DO:
Update Bullet to 2.81. BRL-CAD fails to compile with Bullet 2.81, so I restored
to 2.80.

Update the Java Runtime Environment. Latest is 1.7.10, installed is 1.7.3.

Using the flags described in "README-brlcad-development.txt", `make install`
installs the files to /usr/brlcad/dev-7.22.1. Is it supposed to install to
dev-7.22.0, or is this okay?

When I first used the VM, ~/brlcad-build was empty, although the README states
that it contains a configured and tested build, followed by `make clean`. After
building and running `make clean` myself, I did not remove the contents of
brlcad-build.
