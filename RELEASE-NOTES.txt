Virtual Machine
===============

The "*.ova" file in this directory is a Virtual Machine (VM) built and
tested on a Windows 7 64-bit host of Oracle's VirtualBox (using
version 4.1.10: http://virtualbox.org/).  The VM contains a turn-key
BRL-CAD development environment.

The intent of the VM is to give Google Summer of Code interns a
good starting place so they can be productive as soon as possible.

You will need about 6 Gb free space on your computer (after the
download) to import the VM into Oracle VirtualBox and run it.

When starting the VM you may get a message about problems with the
network adapter.  If you cannot start the VM successfully, you may
have to experiment with the VM's network settings to find something
that works for your VirtualBox host's harware.

In the event nothing works for getting access to the network, you can
choose to use no network at all.  Please read the VirtualBox
documentation and then ask for help from the BRL-CAD developers if you
don't find an answer quickly.

The VM is set to autoboot and autologin.  The user name is "brlcad"
with a password of "Brlcad!" (you should change the password upon
first login).

Note: To access the VM boot menu, press and hold the <SHIFT> key after
starting the VM.

mount -n -o remount,ro -t ext2 /dev/sda1 /


Configuration Notes
===================

The Firefox browser has links on the bookmarks tool bar grouped by
major dependency or category.  There are folder icons on the desktop
for common BRL-CAD source code references, and important working
sub-directories in the home directory.  Note that the "Downloads"
directory can be removed but it tends to reappear if you download
through Firefox and don't change its download defaults.

The "brlcad-svn" directory has the brlcad/trunk current as of
2012-03-16 and the "brlcad-build "directory has a configured and
tested build followed by a "make clean" command.  The
"README.txt" describes a recommended configuration and
build sequence for use inside the build directory.

The "Documentation" directory has BRL-CAD documents from the BRL-CAD
site.  The "Other" directory has documents from the Bullet library
home site.

The successful trunk build (debug, with pdf extra docs) is installed
in the default location (/usr/brlcad/dev-7.21.0).  The PATH and
MANPATH reflect that location, and Firefox has links to the installed
BRL-CAD documentation.

The latest CMake, Bullet Physics, and Apache FOP are installed, and
the environment variable APACHE_FOP points to the fop executable.

Editors vi, emacs, and jEdit are installed alongside the simple gedit.

The latest Java runtime environment from Oracle is installed.

The ~/.bash-aliases file has some handy aliases for getting around:

 cad='cd ~/brlcad-svn'
 cabd='cd ~/brlcad-build'
 svu='svn update'
 svs='svn status'

There are other aliases for safe versions of destructive commands (cp,
rm, mv) and shortcuts for commonly-used commands and options.

There is also a PERL5LIB environment variable set for the current
directory:

 PERL5LIB=.
